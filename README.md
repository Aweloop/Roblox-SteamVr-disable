This Powershell script renames the Steam VR folder when run, that way Roblox wont start in VR mode.
It is a toggle so if you run it again it fixes the name and steam vr works like normal.

THIS IS A POWERSHELL SCRIPT THAT NEEDS ADMIN PERMS SO I SUGGEST LOOKING THROUGH THE CODE FIRST

also if you dont use the standard install location you will have to change the path in the code itself. 
(if you need help message me on discord (remove spaces): @ t h e _ r e a l _ r o b i n)
